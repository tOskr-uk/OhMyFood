QUESTIONS
- fyi, a typo in the home page navigation 'Chose' should be spelt 'Choose'.
- Project brief talks about 'buttons'. Are the 3 x elements in the 'How it works' section buttons?
- Would you agree the restaurant body elements belong in layout rather than components?
- Restaurant pages. body element is pushed up 40px leaving a gap at the bottom. Is there a better 
  method to fill this gap than a negative margin?




TODO
