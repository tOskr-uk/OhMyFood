QUESTIONS
- Assumed typo in the home page navigation 'Chose' should be spelt 'Choose'.
- Project brief talks about 'buttons'. Are the 3 x elements in the 'How it works' section buttons?
- i noticed on booki the checkbox i used for the filters was hidden and meant to be repositioned 
   outside the confines of the docuemtn but is only positioned 100px out of its original place on 
   both x and y coords. Can i cnange to 1000 before submitting or will it be acceptable?
- Project brief states a mobile first build but then states '...When hovering, the background color 
  of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible...' But 
  there is no hover effect on mobile devices?




TODO
- Make location section clickable with an anchor tag.
