QUESTIONS
- Restaurant pages. body element is pushed up 40px leaving a gap at the bottom. Is there a better 
  method to fill this gap than a negative margin?



TODO
- Look at replacing the checkboxes with a focs pseudo class.
- Remove box shadow from restaurant headers.
- check prices on all restaurant pages against the mockups.
- Check menus for french chars and add as required (found one on dessert section of restaurant_4).
- Check again text color of menu text, some look dark grey some black.
