QUESTIONS
- MENU PAGES ANIMATION (Page 6): "...The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them...."
  Pseudo class focus only applies to 1 element at a time. Without JS or hidden checkbox i can only get this 
  animation to appear on a single menu item. This ok?
- MENU PAGES ANIMATION (Page 6): "...If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension
  points. An example of the expected effect is provided..." Example animation and mockup cards do not show 
  suspension points on the dish title. They do show them on the description which is how I have built the 
  project. This ok? 
- I think im getting a bit obsessed with controlling the card height which I may need to create custom classes to control 
  their heights to better manage how they react to the animation when hovered or clicked. Are thes eimperfections acceptable 
  for the scope of this project? Or will i need to add the custom classes? This is for the menu cards (See 'The Enchanted Plate')
- Consider leaving tablet breakpoint the same as mobile else too much of the menu text is hidden away.
