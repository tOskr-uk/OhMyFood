QUESTIONS
- fyi, a typo in the home page navigation 'Chose' should be spelt 'Choose'.
- Project brief talks about 'buttons'. Are the 3 x elements in the 'How it works' section buttons?
- Would you agree the restaurant body elements belong in layout rather than components?
- Restaurant pages. body element is pushed up 40px leaving a gap at the bottom. Is there a better 
  method to fill this gap than a negative margin?
- The brief states that the 'header' is present on all pages but the home page contains the logo and
  the menu pages contain a button to return to the home page.
  Q1: What do you meen by 'home page contains the logo'? All pages look like they contain the logo?
  Q2: The requirement to have a 'back to homepage' button on the restaurant pages but NOT the home
    page. Can i simply add / remove the relevant elements? This would technicaly meen the headers are
    not the same? Or is these some fancy way of doing this? Only way I can think is to have a second
    unique style sheet for each page where the button is hidden for the home page. Is there a menthod?
- suspension points are to be used on menu pages. Some of the menu text already have suspention points
  and i cant tell with certainty what the menu text was. Can i guess and is it important if i guess wrong?
- Do i need to make the mouseover animation on the menu cards stick when they are selected? How to do
  without checkbox hack?
- Display the location of restaurants. WHat does this meen?



TODO
