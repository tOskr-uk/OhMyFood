QUESTIONS
- Restaurant pages. body element is pushed up 40px leaving a gap at the bottom. Is there a better 
  method to fill this gap than a negative margin?
- MENU PAGES ANIMATION (Page 6): "...The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them...."
  Pseudo class focus only applies to 1 element at a time. Without JS or hidden checkbox i can only get this 
  animation to appear on a single menu item. This ok?
- MENU PAGES ANIMATION (Page 6): "...If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension
  points. An example of the expected effect is provided..." Example animation and mockup cards do not show 
  suspension points on the dish title. They do show them on the description which is how I have built the 
  project. This ok? 
- Consider leaving tablet breakpoint the same as mobile else too much of the menu text is hidden away. 



TODO
- Look at replacing the checkboxes with a focs pseudo class.
- Remove box shadow from restaurant headers.
- Check menus for french chars and add as required (found one on dessert section of restaurant_4).
- Check again text color of menu text, some look dark grey some black.
